# Portfolio

## Description

Drafted up a first version of a portfolio to use as I contiune working. I struggled a lot with this and it still needs quite a bit of work. Did my best to demonstrate usage of deeper css topics including flex box. I ran into trouble while working on my work container section and would appreciate any helpful comments so I can make this application even better. All links are currenlty working and I have provided an example of my previous bootcamp challange at least.
